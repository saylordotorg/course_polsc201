**Unit 3: Liberal Democracy and Its Critics** <span id="3"></span> 
*We will conclude this course by discussing various conceptualizations
of political and social equality and addressing ways that political
thought shifted away from a belief in the primacy of the sovereign state
and the legitimacy of elites. We will also discuss how Jean-Jacques
Rousseau developed the notion of participatory democracy, the
egalitarian view that constituents should be directly involved in the
direction and operation of political systems. This concept would be used
in both Alexis de Tocqueville’s examination of government in young
America and Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’s critique of political
liberalism as the ideology of the rich. This unit will serve as both a
historical study and a platform for discussing today’s competing
political theories about the role of the state in the redistribution of
resources, the government’s role in the economy, and the differences
between what we do and what we believe.*

     Instructions: Please read this text. Notice that Rousseau uses
    history and travel experience to show that humans have slowly
    evolved from brute animality to moderate sociability and eventually
    corruption and inequality as the rich have taken over government.
    Rousseau is famous for developing the idea that freedom exists in
    three forms: civil, natural, and moral.  
      
     Study Guide Questions:  
      
     Does Rousseau advocate a return to the state of nature?  
      
     What role does the notion of private property play in Rousseau’s
    thought?  
      
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and answering the study guide
    questions should take approximately 6 hours.

     Instructions: Watch this lecture. Rousseau proposes a social
    contract that “defends and protects with all common forces the
    person and goods of each associate, and by means of which each one,
    while uniting with all, nevertheless obeys only himself and remains
    as free as before.” Also consider Professor Smith’s description of
    the emergence of government types. Layer by layer, they have
    developed as philosophical reasoning expanded the boundaries of
    Western society’s political thinking.

     Rousseau lived in a very different era, but his exploration of the
    place of the individual in society has significant relevance in the
    21<sup>st</sup> century. His works address many of today's worries,
    especially about social inequality and dysfunctional democracy. What
    would Rousseau have to say about the U.S. political system if he
    were alive today?

     Instructions: Please read this text. As you read *theSocial
    Contract*, consider the United States Constitution, particularly as
    amended by The Bill of Rights. Many of the concepts therein

    Fathers’ reliance upon and interpretation of Rousseau.  
      
     Study Guide Questions:  
      
     Can individuals be free, in the aftermath of Rousseau’s social
    contract that involves the “total alienation of each associate of

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the entire
    text. In his essay *On the Jewish Question*, Marx takes issue with
    Bruno Bauer – one of his colleagues among the Young Hegelians. Bauer
    had earlier made an argument against Jewish emancipation from the
    German Christian state from an atheist perspective, arguing that
    religion whether Jewish or Christian was a barrier to emancipation.
    In responding to Bauer, Marx introduces his distinction between
    political emancipation in form of liberal rights and liberties, and
    human emancipation, which encompasses an end to alienation from our
    work and from each other.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this preface, which constitutes a sketch of
    Marx’s framework for historical materialism. He argues that the
    nature of a society’s economic structure depends upon the degree of
    development of the productive forces or means of production, meaning
    human labor conjoined with technology. The relations of production
    or superstructure, meaning the political and legal institutions of
    society, is in turn explained by the nature of the economic
    structure. Revolution occurs, however, when the forces of production
    are stifled by the superstructure, which is replaced by a structure
    better suited to preside over the continued development of the
    forces of production.

     Instructions: Read this chapter. Marx begins by establishing two
    necessary conditions for commodity production: (i) a market and (ii)
    a social division of labor where people make different things. For
    Marx, commodities both have a use-value, and an exchange-value or
    price, but it is the latter which is problematic. In coming to
    understand why one commodity is priced differently from another,
    Marx derives his labor theory of value.

     Instructions: Read Chapter 14 of Marx’s *Capital,* “Counteracting
    Influences,” and then read Marx’s *Critique of the Gotha Program*.
    In “Counteracting Influences,” Marx shows the effects of his law
    that within a capitalist economic structure, the tendency of the
    rate of profit must fall. This leads to increasing intensity of
    exploitation as well as other effects that contribute to the
    downfall of capitalism. In the *Critique of the Gotha Program,* Marx
    describes the transition from a capitalist to a socialist to a
    communist society, and it is here where he describes communism as a
    society in which each person should contribute according to their
    ability and receive according to their need.

    study Marx today, and gives an overview of a contemporary strain of
    political thought called Analytical Marxism. From there, the
    importance of the principle of self-ownership in Marx’s framework is
    traced, and how that principle corresponds to contemporary debates
    regarding distributive justice – particularly “the difference
    principle” in the work of John Rawls.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please read this article, which attempts to reconcile
    the tension between Mill’s principle of liberty and his invocation
    of utilitarianism. The difficulty lies in that the principle of
    liberty disqualifies utility-promotion as a reason for restraint of
    liberty, unless such restraint also prevents harm to others. Yet at
    the same time, once the harm-to-others threshold presented by the
    principle of liberty is crossed and liberty-limitation is
    justifiable, it becomes justified according to the balance of
    restraint of liberty and prevention of harm as assessed by a
    utilitarian calculation.  By appealing to perfectionist tendencies
    in Mill’s thought, and particularly his notion of “the permanent
    interests of man as a progressive being,” the principle of liberty
    can be seen less in the light of problems with regard to utilitarian
    calculation and more as an indispensable pillar for what Mill would
    have us aspire to be both as a tolerant society and as autonomous
    individuals.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

**Course Summary** <span id="3.7"></span> 
-   **Reading: Course Summary**
    Hopefully this course has given you a thoughtful and lucid account
    of the most important political thinkers and the enduring themes of
    the last two and a half millennia. As you’ve seen, Western political
    thought encompasses a variety of differences and schools of thought.
    For example, in Unit 1 we discussed the origins of Western thinking
    on the polis, or city-state. Plato and Aristotle both discuss the
    ideal polis through their consideration of governance, citizenship,
    social order, and personal virtue. Essentially, their works
    ultimately ask the question “what is the ideal state?” While Plato
    feels that a ruler with philosophical training should govern the
    polis, he also asks several questions in the *Republic*, such as:
    Why do men behave justly? Do the stronger elements of society scare
    the weak into submission in the name of law? Or do men behave justly
    because it is good for them to do so? Is justice, regardless of its
    rewards and punishments, a good thing in and of itself? How do we
    define justice? In the *Apology*, Socrates (on trial for his life)
    is less concerned with political doctrine than in defining the ideal
    philosopher.  
      
     In *Crito*, interestingly enough, Socrates seems quite willing to
    accept his imminent execution, because in his estimation he would be
    aiding his enemies in wronging him unjustly, and would thus be
    acting unjustly himself, essentially violating the social contract.
    And, finally, in *Nicomachean Ethics,* Aristotle’s most
    comprehensive work on ethics, he conceives of ethical theory as a
    field distinct from the theoretical sciences. Its methodology must
    match its subject matter – good action – and must respect the fact
    that in this field many generalizations hold only for the most part.
    We study ethics in order to improve our lives, he argues, and
    therefore its principal concern is the nature of human well-being.
    Aristotle follows Socrates and Plato in taking the virtues to be
    central to a well-lived life. Like Plato, he regards the ethical
    virtues (justice, courage, temperance and so on) as complex
    rational, emotional, and social skills. But he rejects Plato’s idea
    that training in the sciences and metaphysics is a necessary
    prerequisite for a full understanding of our good. To quote
    Socrates, “the unexamined life is not worth living.” These ancient
    Greek philosophers did just this, laying the foundation for the
    first comprehensive examination of the state and its relationship to
    its citizens.  
      
     In Unit 2, we turned our focus to modern political philosophers –
    Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Locke. While the ancient Greek polis served
    as influential models of governance and citizens for centuries – the
    world was becoming much more complex. As such, these thinkers
    approached the relationship of the state to its citizens in a much
    more realistic way. Machiavelli’s *The Prince* is essentially an
    extended analysis of how to acquire and maintain political power.
    Machiavelli draws many of his examples in *The Prince* from
    contemporary Italian politics and its main political powers. He was
    one of the first political philosophers to conceive and create
    politics as an art form, in which the best rulers should be cruel
    rather than merciful, should break promises if keeping them would be
    against their interests, undertake great projects to enhance their
    reputation, and avoid making themselves hated and despised (the
    goodwill of the people is a better defense than any fortress).  
      
     Thomas Hobbes was an admirer of Machiavelli and used his principles
    on the artificiality of the state in *Leviathan*, which established
    the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the
    perspective of social contract theory. Hobbes was a champion of the
    absolutism of the sovereign. According to Hobbes, society is a
    population beneath a sovereign authority, to whom all individuals in
    that society cede some rights for the sake of protection. Any abuses
    of power by this authority are to be accepted as the price of peace.
    There is no doctrine of separation of powers in Hobbes’s discussion.
    According to Hobbes, the sovereign must control civil, military,
    judicial, and ecclesiastical powers.  
      
     John Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, was
    also a proponent of a strict sovereign, but he believed that any
    government that rules without the consent of the people can, in
    theory, be overthrown. He did argue that all men are created equal
    in the state of nature by God. From this, he goes on to explain the
    hypothetical rise of property and civilization, in the process
    explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have
    the consent of the people – a constitutional government. The
    theories of these three philosophers helped in the development of
    the modern state.  
      
     The final unit of this course focuses on contemporary political
    philosophy, mostly in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. Historically,
    this was a time of tremendous technological advancement – rapid
    industrialization coupled with clear social class divisions. Here,
    these thinkers consider issues of the legitimacy of the elites, the
    notion of participatory democracy, and the redistribution of
    resources between the rich and the poor. Rousseau, for example,
    argues in his *Discourse* that the only natural inequality among men
    is the inequality that results from differences in physical
    strength, for this is the only sort of inequality that exists in the
    state of nature. As Rousseau explains, however, in modern societies
    the creation of laws and property have corrupted natural men and
    created new forms of inequality that are not in accordance with
    natural law. Rousseau calls these unjustifiable, unacceptable forms
    of inequality moral inequality, and he concludes by making clear
    that this sort of inequality must be contested.  
      
     The Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville, during his travels in
    19<sup>th</sup>-century America, analyzed why republican
    representative democracy succeeded in the United States while
    failing in so many other places. However, he warned of possible
    threats *to* democracy and possible dangers *of* democracy
    (including tyranny of the majority).  
      
     Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels crafted theories about society,
    economics and politics – collectively known as Marxism – which hold
    that all societies progress through the dialectic of class struggle:
    a conflict between an ownership class which controls production and
    a lower class which produces the labor for goods. Again, they were
    both warning of Industrial Revolution, which was spreading rapidly
    throughout Europe. This unit served as both a historical study and a
    platform for discussing today’s political debate on class inequality
    and the role of government in the economy and in the redistribution
    of resources.
