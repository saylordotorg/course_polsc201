**Unit 2: Modern Political Thought** <span id="2"></span> 
*The Greek polis served as an influential model of citizenship and
governance for centuries. Modern political philosophers, however, found
that they needed to rethink politics according to a new, more realistic
understanding of the way humans actually behave. As a result, modern
government requires both a keen historical sense and the pragmatic use
of power.*  
    
 *This unit will begin with the Italian political philosopher and civil
servant Niccolò Machiavelli. Machiavelli is credited with the distinctly
modern notion of an artificial (rather than natural) state in which the
leader should rule swiftly, effectively, and in a calculated manner.
Many associate his theories with the use of deceit and cunning in
politics; after Machiavelli, politics was conceived of as an art in
which the best rulers governed shrewdly, carefully calculating about
enemies, populations, and the timing of certain actions.*  
    
 *Thomas Hobbes adapted this Machiavellian approach on a much larger
scale. For Hobbes, the state should be sovereign and secular; the
citizens should give up both their allegiance to the Church and their
rights in exchange for physical security. However, while modern
political thought has been built upon the Machiavellian notion of the
artificiality of the state, the moderns disagreed on how people behaved
and on the degree of a government’s strength and pervasiveness necessary
to properly govern citizens.*  
    
 *John Locke responded to a strict concept of sovereignty with the idea
of constitutional government. Like Hobbes, Locke imagined a civil
society capable of resolving conflicts in a civil way, with help from
government. However, Locke also advocated the separation of powers and
believed that revolution is not only a right but, at times, an
obligation of citizenship. These three thinkers represent the foundation
of modern state theory.*

    Machiavelli's The Prince**

    (Free)  
      
     Instructions: Please read Chapters I-XVII of *The Prince, which*
    covers subunits 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. In many ways, Machiavelli is
    considered the first *modern*political scientist. In *The Prince*,
    Machiavelli argues that successful statecraft requires tools that
    many traditional philosophical and political ideals simply could not
    provide, and he sees politics as a public responsibility that cannot
    be based upon the same ethics that guide private life.  
      
     Study Guide Questions:  
      
     What is Machiavelli’s view of human nature?  
      
     Is Machiavelli’s approach to government similar to or different
    from Plato’s idealized vision in *The Republic*, and how so?  
      
     How is Machiavelli’s concept of virtue similar to or different from
    that of Aristotle’s?  
      
     Machiavelli questions whether it is better for the prince to be
    loved by the people or feared by the people. He argues that both are
    important, and if possible, the prince should be equally feared and
    loved. However, he also calls this an unattainable ideal, and
    finally concludes that the prince should choose to be feared, rather
    than loved, by the people. Is Machiavelli right?

    As you watch, consider Machiavelli’s background compared to that of
    Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The political landscape of Europe
    was considerably bigger and more complex during the Renaissance and
    thus allowed Machiavelli to advance some of the first true political
    concepts and models.

    (Free)  
      
     Instructions: This work covers subunits 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. As you
    read, consider whether you think it would be possible for Hobbes to
    make the claims he does *without* Machiavelli’s theories laid out

     Thomas Hobbes designed the first theory of the sovereign state. In
    *Leviathan*, he sees life before the emergence of states as “nasty,
    brutish, and short” and envisions the Leviathan, a sovereign state
    led by a king who indiscriminately rules over his territory and
    citizenry. In turn, citizens give up their freedom for security.  
      
     Study Guide Questions:

     Instructions: Please read this text. While Hobbes saw human nature
    as brutal, Locke’s thinking reflected the ideals of the European
    Enlightenment. For enlightenment thinkers, people were broadly
    considered to be equal and independent. Locke’s thinking
    revolutionized how people thought about citizenship by proposing
    that all individuals have a right to “life, liberty, and
    property.”  
      
     Also consider the rights of private ownership in the United States.
    As these rights are not directly spelled out in the Constitution, it
    can be said that Locke’s influence was once again a driving
    philosophical force in the American mind as the Industrial
    Revolution was progressing.  
      
     Study Guide Questions:  
      
     Describe and evaluate Locke’s defense of property rights. Bear in
    mind the distinction between rights over one’s person
    (self-ownership rights) and rights over material resources (world
    ownership rights).  
      
     Explain Locke’s doctrine of consent to government. Is the doctrine
    strictly necessary to his account of legitimate government?
    Carefully distinguish between different kinds of consent (explicit,
    tacit, etc.), and pay close attention to conquest and usurpation,
    where power is acquired without a contract.  
      
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and answering the study guide
    questions should take approximately 10 hours.

     Consider Locke’s influence on Abraham Lincoln. Both Lincoln and his
    rival Stephen Douglas professed that consent was necessary to grant
    slavery legal status in the US However, the concept of consent is
    pivotal. Why is Stephen Douglas’s concept of consent to slavery
    considered flawed logic by Professor Smith?  
      
     Also, consider the rights of private ownership in the United
    States. As these rights are not directly spelled out in the

     Instructions: Watch this lecture. For Enlightenment thinkers, all
    people were equal and independent, and this allowed new credible
    political ideologies to develop. Consider the pre-Enlightenment
    views of the ruling classes in European countries as compared to the
    United States, which theoretically had an open and free political
    system in which all were able to participate. Also take note that a
    key tenet of Lockean philosophy is the right of the people to revolt
    against a government that is corrupt or otherwise unable to carry
    out the wishes of its constituency.

     In his “Second Treatise,” John Locke maintains the natural liberty
    of human beings; all people are born free, and the attempt to
    enslave any person creates a state of war. Yet Locke himself had
    invested in the slave trade and drafted the *Fundamental
    Constitutions of Carolina* which granted absolute power over slaves.
    How do you think Locke reconciled his beliefs with his actions (if
