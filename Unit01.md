**Unit 1: The Polis** <span id="1"></span> 
*This first unit deals with the origins of Western thinking on the*
*polis, which is the Greek word for city-state. We will read Plato’s
famous work, the* Republic*, which presents an extended argument in
dramatic form for what might constitute the ideal polis, encompassing
consideration of all aspects of governance, citizenship, social order,
and personal virtue. Speaking through the character of his teacher
Socrates, Plato’s model of the ideal city-state mirrors the order of
nature as based in his metaphysical Theory of Forms, famously
articulated here in the *Republic *through the* Allegory of The
Cave*.*  
  
 *Plato’s streamlined view of political and social life holds that the
city-state should be governed by a ruler with philosophical training
capable of comprehending the true nature of reality, justice, and
wisdom, and where one’s place in society is determined by one’s natural
abilities. By contrast, Plato’s student Aristotle, while incorporating
and responding to many aspects of Platonic thought, develops a decidedly
organic, or this-worldly, system of ethics and a corresponding structure
for the polis as embodied in the texts of the* Nicomachean Ethics *and
the *Politics. *Aristotle’s famous claim that "man is by nature a
political animal" captures his belief that a natural order between the
individual and the community exists as both a power struggle and a
distribution of resources, which has as its own end the good held both
individually and in common. Such ideal notions of the city-state,
whether Platonic or Aristotelian, and the particulars therein, have been
a point of departure for political philosophers since the time of
Plato’s Athens to the present day.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe the social order and governance of society as presented in
    Plato’s **Republic**;
-   explain the narrative of Socrates’s trial and subsequent death as
    told in Plato’s *Apology* and *Crito*;
-   compare and contrast the arguments of Socrates in the *Apology* and
    *Crito* with his arguments in the **Republic**;
-   discuss the concepts of justice, equality, citizenship, and virtue
    as presented in the **Republic** with those presented in Aristotle’s
    *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Politics*; and
-   explain how Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics* forms the basis for
    conceptions of government in *Politics,* and why Aristotle considers
    aristocracy based in virtue as the ideal form of government over
    oligarchy or democracy.

     Instructions: Please read Book I and Book II. Through the voice of
    his teacher Socrates, Plato defines what he considers the ideal
    forms of justice, leadership, social order, and philosophical
    discipline throughout *The* *Republic.* At the same time, Plato
    addresses the tension between the pursuit of individual
    self-perfection and public service.  
      
     In Book I, Socrates begins by attempting to define justice by
    challenging notions held by Cephalus and Polemarchus. Socrates finds
    their notions wanting, but nonetheless they continue to hold that it
    is better for a person to be just than unjust. Thrasymachus
    challenges the assumption that it is good to be just altogether. In
    Book II, Socrates accepts the challenge from Glaucon and Adeimantus
    to argue that it is better for a person to be just than unjust and
    that justice is a good in itself regardless of the consequences
    associated with it. Socrates begins, however, by looking for justice
    as a virtue of cities before defining justice as a virtue of
    persons. He outlines his first version of an ideal city and the
    producer class of citizens established under the principle of
    specialization that each person must perform the role for which he
    is naturally best suited.

     Instructions: Please read Books III and IV of the*R*epublic.**
    Socrates presents his second form of the ideal city, comprised of
    three classes: rulers, guardians, and producers. He defines their
    respective roles, along with the qualities, education, and training
    appropriate to them. By the end of Book IV, Socrates proclaims the
    city just. By identifying justice at the level of the city, Socrates
    hopes to make an analogous definition of justice as a virtue at the
    personal level. Keep in mind that it is a long-standing point of
    contention among scholars as to Plato’s intent behind presenting
    the *Republic* as a utopia.

    as well as issues associated with war. In defending how such a
    lifestyle could come into being and be sustained, Socrates
    introduces the notion that the only possible way for the ideal
    society to exist is if the rulers are philosophers – his concept of
    the “philosopher-king.”

     Instructions: Please read the *Apology*. This work deals with
    Socrates’s reasoned self-defense when he is falsely charged with
    crimes against the state.  
      
     Study Guide Questions:  
      
     How would you describe the Socratic Method? Think about what Plato
    demonstrates with the argument between Aristophanes and Socrates.
    Note that Aristophanes represents past and present poets of
    Socrates’s era and is thus oracular in nature, whereas Socrates is
    conversational, meaning dialectical.  
      
     Consider Socrates’s poverty in the context of virtue. In *The
    *Apology**, Plato describes Socrates’s poverty as a sort of “proof”
    that he was not a paid teacher – that he was only living his life in
    response to the proclamation by the Delphic Oracle that no one was
    as wise as Socrates. Is this convincing, and how so?  
      
     Reading this work and answering the study guide questions should
    take approximately 4 hours.

     Instructions: Watch this lecture. As you watch, remember that in
    the *Apology*, Socrates faces a trial not only in a court of law,
    but also in the court of public opinion. Socrates makes his case
    both to the masses and to the judicial, civil, and political
    establishment. He knows that his argument is probably the last of
    his life, and thus he seeks to spur further dialogue among his
    fellow Athenians. Pause as needed to take notes.

**1.4.2 Poetry and Philosophy** <span id="1.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered, in part, by the lecture beneath subunit
1.4.1 and in the text of the* Apology *at paragraphs 17d to 24c. As you
might recall from the lecture, at 18d, Socrates mentions a “writer of
comedies” in reference to the playwright Aristophanes. Throughout
Plato’s dialogues, and most thoroughly in Book X of the* Republic*,
Plato addresses what he calls the long-running quarrel between
philosophy and poetry (and the arts in general, including that of
rhetoric). It could be said Aristophanes represents poets of the past
(or Socrates’s present) and is one of Socrates’s foremost critics for
his emphasis on the primacy of philosophy. Poets, on the other hand (and
only in their best light, according to Socrates), are oracular in
nature, meaning they serve as a kind of channel or link between the gods
and the masses. This contrasts with Socrates’s conversational, or
dialectical, method, which emphasizes argumentation based in reason to
arrive at truth and to what makes for a good individual, citizen, and
society.*

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation's Socratic Method Short Answer
    Question**
    Instructions: As you now understand, the classic Socratic Method
    involves dismantling prior ideas in order to free the mind of
    preconceived notions. By definition, this method deconstructs all
    prior thoughts on a topic and leaves the learner without a
    satisfactory answer to the primary question. Examining how the
    Socratic Method is used in contemporary society – particularly by
    teachers, legal scholars, and medical practitioners – will help you
    understand this approach to teaching and learning.  
      
     Write a short paragraph explaining why you believe these
    professions are more inclined to use the Socratic Method of
    instruction. Feel free to share your thoughts on the Saylor
    Foundation’s discussion forum for POLSC201, as referenced in subunit
    1.2.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.

    (Free)  
      
     Instructions: Please read *Crito.* Note that this work applies to
    subunits 1.5.1-1.5.3. *Crito* is an account of Socrates’s
    explanation for accepting the death sentence for his alleged crimes
    rather than confessing and taking a lesser sentence. He tells his
    friend Crito that, although he has been falsely convicted, he would
    rather accept the punishment because it will uphold the rule of law
    in Athens. He prefers to die rather than live outside of the law or
    in a fashion that would undermine the law. Note that the form of
    Plato’s account – a series of dialogues among friends – is important
    to Plato’s thought.  
      
     Study Guide Question:  
      
     Explain how Socrates views the acceptance of his conviction and
    consequent execution not as a form of suicide, but as an alignment
    with what is right, regardless of whether he has been wrongly
    accused and convicted by the people of Athens.  
      
     Reading this selection and answering the study guide question

    Transcript ](http://oyc.yale.edu/political-science/plsc-114/lecture-3)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this lecture. As you watch, think about Crito’s
    appeal to Socrates. Crito represents a Homeric, traditional type of
    citizen of his age. His appeal is a logical one viewed through the
    lens of the self, but Socrates is not swayed. He rejects the notion
    that a citizen must live out a public existence with displays of
    patriotism, nobility, and devotion to the state. Note that these
    actions are not the same as compliance with the law of the land.  
      
     In the last third of the lecture, notice how Professor Smith makes
    the case that the juxtaposition of Socrates’s exposed views in
    *Crito* and *The *Republic** cannot be reconciled. Professor Smith
    believes that Plato purposefully exposed his readers to Socrates’s
    conflicting philosophies in an attempt to demonstrate that society
    must choose either one of the Socratic models, or neither – but not
    both. Pause as needed to take notes.  
      
     Watching this lecture and taking notes should take approximately 1

     Instructions: Please read Book I of Aristotle’s *Nicomachean
    Ethics*. The *Nicomachean Ethics* is Aristotle’s most comprehensive
    work on ethics and establishes ethical inquiry as a field unto its
    own apart from other fields of inquiry. In this text, Aristotle
    sustains the Platonic dialogue on how society should best be
    organized, but he does so by focusing on the codification of
    virtuous behavior and what it means for a person to live a good
    life. Pause as needed to take notes.

     Instructions: Please read Book II of Aristotle’s *Nicomachean
    Ethics*. Book II sets out to discover how we can determine what is
    virtuous, or that which is fine or excellent, such that our
    practical reason can be in accordance with it, both in the sense of
    actions to be taken and ends to be achieved. What Aristotle
    determines is that what is virtuous with regard to a person’s
    character can be found between the extremes as to what it is not –
    or the mean between the two vices of excess and deficiency.

     Instructions: Please read Book III of Aristotle’s *Nicomachean
    Ethics*. After describing what is virtuous in Book II, Aristotle
    gives an outline of what must be in place if virtuous action is to
    result. What constitutes virtuous action is dependent on a variety
    of external factors as well as the mindset and character of the
    actor. Aristotle distinguishes between actions taken voluntarily and
    involuntarily. He determines that actions must be voluntary if they
    are to be virtuous and thus worthy of praise.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please read Books IV-V of Aristotle’s *Nicomachean
    Ethics*. In Book IV, Aristotle explains how we may determine what is
    virtuous through the doctrine of the mean using examples of
    individual virtues such as bravery, generosity, and temperance. In
    Book V, Aristotle discusses the virtue of justice, which carries an
    exalted status among the virtues. Aristotle makes a distinction
    between two different but related types of justice: the general and
    the special (or particular). Of general justice, he writes, “this
    type of justice then, is complete virtue, not complete virtue
    unconditionally, but complete virtue in relation to another. And
    this is why justice often seems to be supreme among the virtues, and
    ‘neither the evening star nor the morning star is so marvelous,’ and
    the proverb says ‘And in justice all virtue is summed up’.” As you
    will see, Aristotle’s conception of justice stands in sharp contrast
    to that of Plato’s, with the realization that individual justice is
    inextricably tied to the common good.

     Instructions: Please read Books VI and X of Aristotle’s
    *Nicomachean Ethics*.  
      
     In subunit 1.6.1, you learned that Aristotle divides virtue into
    two sorts that correspond to the rational and non-rational parts of
    the soul. The rational part is that which has reason within itself
    or is reason “through-and-through,” while the non-rational part is
    capable of being influenced by reason. Book VI of the *Ethics* first
    addresses the non-rational part of the soul*,* which is integral to
    Book X and the transition made from the *Ethics* to Aristotle’s
    *Politics.* Here, we first address the intellectual virtues applied
    to the non-rational parts of the soul in Book VI, or the virtues of
    thought associated with our emotions, feelings, dispositions, and
    actions, before turning to Book X.

     Instructions: Please read this text, which covers the topics
    outlined beneath subunits 1.7.1-1.7.3. As you read, think about the
    *Nicomachean Ethics* and pay attention to how Aristotle weaves
    ethical precepts into the fabric of political action. Aristotle
    argues that a law that mirrors the natural order is of the highest
    good to the polis. Citizenship is rationed (i.e., only free,
    land-owning males of native ancestry are considered citizens), but
    comes with serious responsibilities, often in the form of public
    service. The question of “who counts as a citizen” is covered by the
    lecture in subunit 1.7.1. As you read, consider the following
    question: who was considered a citizen, and who was excluded from
    this category?  
      
     Study Guide Questions:  
      
     Aristotle objected to Plato that his search for unity ended by
    abolishing what is distinctively political about politics. What is
    the nature of the complaint, and is Aristotle right?  
      
     Aristotle states: “[M]echanics or any other class that is not the
    producer of virtue have no share in the state.” What do you think
    about this view of citizenship?  
      
     Reading this selection, taking notes, and answering the study guide
    questions should take approximately 10 hours. Because this reading
    is lengthy, you mind find it helpful to read it over the course of a

**1.7.3 Distributive Justice as the Task of the Polis** <span

-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Distributive Justice as the Task
    of the Polis”**

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please read the article. In Book III of *Politics,*
    Aristotle analyzes arguments for and against various constitutions
    that employ different notions of a person’s worth. This includes his
    preferred notion of distributive justice as proportionate equality
    taken from Book V of *Ethics*: justice requires that benefits be
    distributed to individuals in proportion to their merit or desert.
    Oligarchs are mistaken in thinking that those who are superior in
    wealth should also have superior political opportunities and
    standing. Democrats are mistaken in thinking that those who are
    equal in free birth should also have correspondingly equal political
    opportunities and standing. Though different in their conception of
    personal worth, for Aristotle both the oligarchs and the democrats
    are mistaken for the same reason: they assume a false conception of
    the ultimate end of the *polis*. Presented here are three different
    interpretations of what Aristotle means by rule of the best persons
    and what the common wellbeing of the polis entails.

    hour.
